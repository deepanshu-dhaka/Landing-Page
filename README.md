# Landing-Page

 This **Landing-Page** is a fun, meme-style landing page that imagines a panel of feline experts offering judgment, wisdom, and questionable advice.  
It’s a parody of decision-making sites, where instead of logic, you get the mysterious verdict of the internet’s most powerful creatures: cats.

- Tech stack: **HTML** and **CSS**
